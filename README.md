# TheFoodies - Assignment 1
A website that displays some of our favorite foods. Each page will feature one of our members' favorite ingredient, favorite recipe that uses that ingredient, and a link to a local restaurant where you can order the dish as well as the address and a Google Maps embed of the location. 

## Our Motivation
We wanted to share our love of food and take the opportunity to bring awareness to local food businesses that are struggling during COVID-19.
